# LITS Leaderboard Destroyer

This script is for Launch Into Space. Honestly, I made this because I was bored and thought Why not mess with the leaderboard. It's simple, fun, and gets the job done.

## Features
- **Spamming Rebirths**: Uses your gems to spam rebirths.
- **Egg Hatching**: Automatically hatches eggs, so you don’t have to click all day.
- **Draggable UI**: Move it wherever you like.
- **RGB UI**: Because why not? RGB makes everything better.

## Please Note
- You NEED a ton of gems for this to work.
- When you click "Start Spamming," it spends your gems to rebirth. Yes, you're losing gems, but that's the point. 

## How to Use
1. Open your Roblox executor (any decent one will do).
2. Copy and paste this loadstring into your executor:
   ```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semze/LITS-leaderboard-destroyer/refs/heads/main/Launch-into-space.lua"))()
   ```
3. Execute the script.
4. Use the buttons to spam rebirths or hatch eggs.

## Disclaimer
- I made this for fun, so use it at your own risk.
- If Roblox moderation comes knocking, that’s on you.
- Oh, and don’t cry if you lose all your gems from rebirthing. That’s literally what this does.
